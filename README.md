## Python_Airbnb_Analysis
This project is part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics course that used data from Airbnb to uncover patterns using geospatial analysis and machine learning models

##Objective
Airbnb is a global community of hosts and travelers that operates as an online marketplace via their website and a mobile app for lodging, homestays, vacations rentals, and tourism activities.  It allows everyday people to share their space and environment by providing guests the feeling of connection and comfortability while exploring a new city. In this analysis, the primary focus is on geographical trends,  and how certain factors like pricing,  room type,  and minimum night stay can have an impact on where guests book.
